This is a collection of the programs from [Algorithmic symphonies from
one line of code -- how and why?] [0], along with scripts to run them.
The programs were posted on YouTube in a couple of videos [one] [1]
and [two] [2], and there's an [online JS HTML5 version by Bemmu and
rarefluid] [3] and some [discussion on Hacker News] [4].

I created this repository so that it’s easier to play with the
programs.  To listen to about 16 seconds of each of them, on Linux,
just type `make`.
